# ENVIRO

ENVIRO is an acronym for (Environmental Novel Versatile & Intelligent Remediation Operations)

ENVIRO is an app that designed to aid in Environmental Remediation through the use of intelligent and versatile algorithms. 
ENVIRO currently has 2 algorithms,
  ## OCTOPAS 
  - Oil spill Cleanup Through an Optimized Pragmatic System
  - Intended to be used for oil spill identification
  
    ### OCTOPAS ARM
      -  OCTOPAS ARM (Adaptive Release Mechanism) 
      - The physical compoenent of OCTOPAS, which acts based off of the output from the algorithm. 
      
  ## CRROW
    -  Catastrophe Relief via Recognition of Obstacle Whereabouts
    - Deisgned to be used in case of various environmental catastrophes
      - The algorithm identifies any walkways 
      - Then it finds any significant obstacles in the pathway
