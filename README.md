# ENVIRO

ENVIRO is an acronym for (Environmental Novel Versatile & Intelligent Remediation Operations)

ENVIRO is an app that designed to aid in Environmental Remediation through the use of intelligent and versatile algorithms. 
ENVIRO currently has 2 algorithms,
  ## OCTOPAS 
  - Oil spill Cleanup Through an Optimized Pragmatic System
  - Intended to be used for oil spill identification

    ### OCTOPAS ARM
      -  OCTOPAS ARM (Adaptive Release Mechanism) 
      - The physical componebnt of OCTOPAS
      - Acts based off of the output from the algorithm
      - Controlled via Bluetooth
      
  ## ORCAS
   -  Obstacle Recognition and Cleanup Automation System
    - Deisgned to be used in case of various environmental catastrophes
      - The algorithm identifies any walkways 
      - Then it finds any significant obstacles in the pathway
    - Will be expanded on in the future
      - Artificial Intelligence (AI)
      - Machine Learning (ML)
      - Internet of Things (IoT) 
      - Physical Component
